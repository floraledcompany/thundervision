    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h5>What is this app for?</h5>
    This app is meant to be a quick and easy way to create consistent project directories for all new projects.
    Simply type in the project title, select a destination folder (i.e. '2019') either by typing in a
    path or using the "Browse" button, and click create!<br><br>
    <h5>What is the template location and project type options for?</h5>
    If desired, a project type can be selected. When the project is created, template project files named after
    the project will be placed in the appropriate folders within the new project directory (thats a lot of 'project's!).
    You can choose general options like "After Effects", or you can populate your project file with more
    specific parameters by choosing "South Board" or "Ribbons", for example.<br>
    If a template project is selected, a valid path to the template folder must be given in the Template Location text
    field. This can be selected using the "Browse" button or by manually typing a path into the text field.<br>
    <i>PLEASE NOTE:</i> If a project type is selected, a valid template path MUST be given in order to click
    'Create Project'.<br><br>

    <h5>What do the colors in the text fields mean?</h5>
    A green field indicates it is valid. White means required but not yet valid. Gray means not currently required
    (for example, if no project types are selected, the template location is not required).
    When a text field is selected, orange indicates invalid. As soon as the field is valid, it will switch
    to green.

    <h5>But it's so annoying to fill it out every time!</h5>
    Thats not a question. Don't worry! We gotchu. The app will remember your last used settings and automatically fill
    them in for you the next time you launch it. All that's required is a title!<br><br>

    <h5>My app doesn't seem to be saving my settings.</h5>
    So we're giving up on the question thing? There's a good chance you are not an admin user on your computer.

    <h5>I tried to save with templates but the project folders were empty.</h5>
    Ok, forget the Q in FAQ, no problem. Its possible you have the wrong template folder selected in Template Location.
    Double check that the selected location is filled with vaild templates. For more info contact the developer at:<br>
